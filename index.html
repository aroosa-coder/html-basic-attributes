    <h1>My Introduction</h1>
    <p>My name is <b>Aroosa Bibi</b> .I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I am doing <i>ADP(CS)</i>
    from University of Centrel Punjab. I’ve always been curious about how websites are built, and now I’m finally diving into it!I’m excited to turn my ideas into real, working web pages.<br/>
<i>Let’s see where this journey takes me! </i>
<blockquote>"Web developers are the architects of the digital world — turning imagination into interaction, one line of code at a time."</blockquote>
<br/> Being a web developer is more than just writing code — it’s about building something from nothing. It’s the joy of seeing your ideas come alive on a screen, knowing that every line you wrote has a purpose. It's a journey full of challenges, errors, and "Aha!" moments. Sometimes things break, sometimes they work like magic — and that’s the beauty of it. Web development teaches patience, problem-solving, and creativity. It’s not just about websites; it’s about creating experiences, solving real-world problems, and connecting people through technology. Every project is a blank canvas, and the developer is the artist with a keyboard instead of a brush.</p>
